During my one-month virtual internship at Oasis Infobyte, I've successfully completed a series of design tasks using Canva. These tasks encompassed creating posters, logos, business cards, and infographics, each tailored to convey specific messages and showcase design skills.
1. Coffee Shop Poster: Designed a vibrant poster promoting a new coffee shop, captivating audiences with enticing imagery and inviting typography to showcase the café's ambiance and falvors.
2. Restaurant Logo: Crafted a distinctive logo for "Home on Your Plate," a restaurant concept that celebrates comfort food and culinary nostalgia, capturing the essence of home-cooked meals through creative visual elements and typography.
3. Nail Artistry Business Card: Created a sleek and stylish business card for "Eclaté Nail Artistry," featuring elegant design elements and personalized branding to make a lasting impression on clients seeking luxurious nail treatments.
4. Self-Care Infographics: Developed engaging infographics on self-care and mindfulness, utilizing captivating visuals, user-friendly layouts, and concise messaging to promote holistic well-being and empower individuals to prioritize self-care practices in their daily lives.
